# Recommendation_System
Collaborative Filtering is a technique used to recommend items to a user based on the preferences of similar users. It does not require item content (like genre, description) — it only needs user-item interaction data (e.g., ratings).
# INTERNSHIP INFORMATION

- Duration : 6weeks
- Domain : Machine learning
- Mentor : Neela Shantosh Kumar
# Task Description
This repository contains a minimal, fully‑worked example of building a user‑based collaborative filtering recommender in pure Pandas + NumPy. It demonstrates how to:
- Construct a user‑item ratings matrix
- Compute cosine similarity between users
- Aggregate scores to generate personalised movie recommendations
# Features
- Uses CIFAR-10 dataset (60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes)
- Multiple convolutional and pooling layers
- Dense layers for classification
- Accuracy tracking over training epochs
- Simple and extendable model
# Techniques Used
- Convolutional Layers: Feature extraction (edges, shapes, patterns)
- ReLU Activation: Introduces non-linearity
- MaxPooling: Reduces spatial dimensions, helps generalize
- Flattening: Converts 2D feature maps into 1D vector
- Dense Layers: Final classification decision
- Adam Optimizer: Adaptive learning optimization
- Cross-Entropy Loss: Suitable for classification tasks
- Data Normalization: Faster convergence, stable training
# Requirements
- pip install tensorflow matplotlib
- Python 3.7+
- Jupyter Notebook or any IDE (VSCode, PyCharm)
